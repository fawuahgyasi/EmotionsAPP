EmotionsAPP
===========
This was a group project. Complete Austy comprised of 3 games of which Emotions was part. Emotions became the final name due to
the unpresentable name Austy(too suggestive of a child with Autism)

Frederick Awuah-Gyasi   Emotions Game
Andrew Proctor          Letters Game
Jose Picado             Vehicles Game. 

The main idea of the Emotions game was to teach the child Two basic Emotions: Happy and Sad. 

Tommy is the baby in the game. 

You pass tommy the items, that makes him happy and HE LAUGHS!
You take tommy's item, that makes him sad.. HE CRIES!..
Simple right.
